However, you may encounter a problem like invalid_key_name: http 400 .
This is because in openstack, when you want launch an instane, you should be the user who create the key. So in order to run the code,
you should create your own key and import it to nectar cloud. Then change the insance_key_name variable use the key you created. The 
file is host_vars/vars.yml.
